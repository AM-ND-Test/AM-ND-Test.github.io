### Deliver water efficiently on or off-grid

Pump water without the need for an electricity source using the latest solar pump solution from Control Techniques, whether your need is to reduce operational costs, improve water security, or be more sustainable.

Applications involving the flow of water in remote areas, where unreliable or no electricity source is available, need a solution that will deliver reliability, efficiency, and a reduced energy requirement. Using solar power means that a pumping system can be installed almost anywhere, irrespective of power infrastructure availability and the associated costs. Harnessing the sun’s natural energy is the most effective way to overcome the challenges of getting water where it needs to be when it needs to be there.

### Where we come in

Depending on the scale of the solution required, both Commander C and Unidrive M600 drive ranges provide a cost-effective and scalable set of features to meet solar pump requirements. Each deliver individual levels of power, communications, and specification capabilities across simple fixed speed to PID controlled pumping. Simply order the standard drive that best meets your application requirements, download Connect commissioning software with the Solar Pump Solution embedded and use the wizard to set up.

### How will you benefit?

If weather conditions aren’t favourable, the drive will automatically select the AC power source, e.g. grid or generator, or a hybrid, to ensure the most efficient continued pump operation. With an environmentally friendly, pollution and noise-free solution all the features you’ll need are already programmed into the drive. You’ll see the benefits in reduced running costs, lower energy requirements and a quick return on investment.

Power options for maximum efficiency
Hassle-free power flexibility for continuous operation

Control Techniques Solar Pump Solution provides reliable pump control, no matter what the weather. Once set-up, the drive can be configured to automatically connect to an AC power source for operation outside daylight hours or as a ‘Hybrid’ System, blending Solar & AC to achieve maximum benefit of your solar investment without affecting performance.
